          On April 18, 2009, the Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA) opened the Katy Managed Lanes for full operation. A new type of roadway for the Houston region, these lanes combine two familiar transportation options—High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes and toll roads—to more flexibly meet the needs of a wide range of commuters, from mass transit and HOV riders to Single Occupancy Vehicles.<br />
          <br />
          The Katy Managed Lanes include two lanes in each direction between State Highway 6 and Interstate Highway 610 West that replace the single, reversible HOV lane. The lanes offer more reliable travel times for METRO buses and HOV riders, while making any unused capacity available to drivers who pay a toll for the potential time savings.<br />
          <br />
          This ambitious project was a team effort of Harris County, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), the Federal Highway Administration and METRO. By partnering with the Texas Department of Transportation to leverage its federal funding, HCTRA provided the resources necessary to fast-track the project, cut construction time in half and offer a new commuting option for our region’s drivers. HCTRA is charged with operating and maintaining the managed lanes. Harris County Constables provide strict enforcement of roadway rules.

        <span class="subheader3">        
        <dt>What are Managed Lanes? </dt></span><p></p>
        <span class="subheader4"><dd>Managed lanes serve the needs of HOV, mass transit and tollway users in a single roadway. Mass transit and HOV riders use the lanes free of charge during HOV hours and any unused capacity is made available to single drivers who pay a toll. Roadway operations are set to keep traffic moving so that all users can benefit from relatively predictable travel times. A flexible traffic-management tool, managed lanes are designed to ease congestion during peak travel periods for all commuters.</dd><p></p></span>
         
         
         
          <span class="subheader3">
          <dt>What's the difference between HOV Lanes and Managed Lanes? </dt></span><p></p>
          <span class="subheader4"><dd> Managed lanes are the next-generation HOV lanes. Traditionally, HOV lanes are available only to those vehicles having the required number of passengers (HOV2+ or HOV3+), which means that valuable roadway capacity often goes unused. Managed lanes maximize this unused capacity by making the roadway available to all vehicles. The needs of mass transit and HOV users remain prioritized by setting toll rates for Single Occupancy Vehicles (SOV) to maintain the flow of traffic during peak hours. During non-peak hours, managed lanes operate like a regular tollway where all drivers (except mass transit) pay a toll to use the road.</dd><p></p></span>
              
              
              
              <span class="subheader3">
              <dt>What's the difference between a Managed Lane and a Toll Road?</dt></span><p></p>
              <span class="subheader4"><dd>On a toll road, all vehicles pay a toll, which is determined by the number of axles. On the Katy Managed Lanes, single drivers pay a toll that varies depending on demand, while mass-transit, motorcycle and HOV2+ users ride free during HOV hours. All other times, the managed lanes function as a regular tollway.</dd><p></p></span>
            
            
            
            <span class="subheader3">
            <dt>What is dynamic tolling and how will it work? </dt></span><p></p>
            <span class="subheader4"><dd><a href="what_is_dynamic_tolling.html" class="blue">Dynamic tolling</a>,  also called “value pricing,” means that the toll rate changes based on variables like the amount of traffic on the roadway and the time of day.</br>
            <br />
            The Katy Managed Lanes toll rates vary by time of day, and follow a schedule that reflects traffic volumes. Tolling does not apply to HOV users during HOV hours.<br />
            <br />
            In the future, a system may be implemented using real-time technology to monitor activity on the managed lanes, with tolls increasing for single drivers as traffic increases in the lanes.</dd><p></p></span>
           
           
           
            <span class="subheader3">
            <dt>Where does the money go that is collected on the Managed Lanes? </dt></span><p></p>
            <span class="subheader4"><dd>The tolls collected from the Katy Managed Lanes—and all HCTRA-managed toll roads—go right back into Harris County and help manage and maintain our system of roadways, as well as help fund the upkeep of other county roads.</dd><p></p></span>
            
            
            
            <span class="subheader3">
            <dt>Aren't these lanes affordable only to those who can pay the premium tolls?  </dt></span><p></p>
            <span class="subheader4"><dd>Managed lanes are designed to help all motorists on the highway. Motorists who need to be somewhere at a certain time have the option to pay a toll to access the managed lanes, which in turn helps ease congestion in the main lanes. Additionally, because HOV users ride free during peak hours, managed lanes encourage people to share rides to avoid congestion, reducing the number of vehicles on the road.</br>
            </br>
            A report from a Los Angeles-based think tank concluded that people of all income levels use managed lanes when they are short of time. For example, a parent who’s running late to pick up a child at daycare will likely spend $2 or $3 on tolls rather than $20 on late fees.<br />
            <br />
            Most drivers will not use the lanes every day. People who choose to stay in the regular lanes pay in minutes instead of money, the report says.

            <span class="subheader4"><dd>HCTRA is committed to maintaining the efficiency of the lanes for their originally intended users—METRO buses, carpoolers and emergency vehicles. To achieve this level of service, tolls must be higher during peak travel hours to keep traffic moving and effectively manage use.</dd><p></p></span>

Some motorists may choose to be regular users and others may only use them when they feel the time savings is offset by the cost of paying a toll. Carpoolers and vanpoolers will always have the option to use the Katy Managed Lanes during peak times at no charge.</dd><p></p></span>

            <span class="subheader4"><dd>The Katy Managed Lanes represent one response to help ease the impact of congestion by offering an alternative to spending valuable time in traffic.

METRO buses and school buses ride free 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Vehicles with two or more occupants can ride free during HOV hours but must pay a toll to use the roadway at all other times. Single drivers who want the benefit of more predictable travel times can only ride the managed lanes by paying a toll.</dd><p></p></span>

            <span class="subheader4"><dd>Yes.

            <span class="subheader4"><dd>HOV users should drive through the tolling area in the left-hand lane, while toll-paying users should use the right-hand lane to declare their status during HOV hours. Follow the clearly posted signs as you approach a tolling area and make any necessary lane changes as far in advance as possible.</dd>

            <span class="subheader4"><dd>Not at this time. The County’s existing toll road system was not designed to incorporate HOV traffic. The Katy Managed Lanes were made possible because of the reconstruction of the Katy Freeway undertaken by the Texas Department of Transportation. </dd><p></p></span>
          
            
            
            <span class="subheader3">

            <span class="subheader4"><dd>Limited land availability, scarce funds and social and environmental issues make building larger and larger freeways impractical. The combination of these factors is forcing transportation planners and engineers to explore new ways to leverage technology to more effectively operate the current transportation network, such as incorporating managed lane facilities into existing roadways.</dd><p></p></span>
